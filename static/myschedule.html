      <h1>MySchedule</h1>
      <p>This page will contain the MySchedule app.</p>
      <h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Add this weeks upcoming to do's and their due dats for each course (homework, exams, chapters to read, concepts to study, etc) </li>
          <li>Schedule each to do item for a day you intend to do it.</li>
          <li>Bang it out and mark items as "completed" when you get them done.</li>
          <li>You will be notified for items that are due TODAY, and for items that are PAST DUE.</li>
          <li>Yes, this is a glorified to do list with a specific application.</li>
      </ol>
